# BackEnd

pom.xml is the dependency file which is organized by Maven for this project.

BackEnd enables users to search twitch resources (stream/video/clip) and set favorite contents after login/logout by session-based authentication. After logging in, we recommend the user more twitch resources by content-based algorithm.
