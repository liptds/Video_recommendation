### A personalized Twitch Resources Recommendation Engine

• Built a full-stack web application for users to search twitch resources (stream/video/clip) with supporting login/logout by session-based authentication and deployed the service to AWS EC2 for better stability.
• Built a web page with rich + user friendly experience using React and Ant Design.
• Implemented RESTful APIs using Java servlets, retrieved real Twitch resources using Twitch API and stored data on MySQL server (AWS RDS) by JDBC.
• Explored multiple recommendation algorithms (e.g., content-based recommendation, collaborative filtering) and extracted game information from Twitch resources to implement a content-based algorithm from user’s favorite.
